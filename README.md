"Collect coins" Game

The rules are very simple - you have to collect all coins moving the player using up/down/right/left keys on your keyboard. You have to avoid collision with red obstacles - every time you lose one from three lives and go back to the starting position. 
Legend added in the left upper corner of the game window updates every time you collect a coin or lose a live.
